# Stock-Market-Analysis
I have taken some data from the stock market of Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. I have visualized different aspects of it, and finally analyzed the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I have also predicted future stocks prices through a Monte Carlo Method!

I have answered the following questions along the way:

  1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
  2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
  3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
  4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
  4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
  5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
  6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
